[Cybernetic Garden](https://angkyle.github.io/iml400/project-1/index.html) is an interactive web page inspired by the poem All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace by by Richard Brautigan.

### Description

IML 400 â€“ September 9, 2021

This web page is inspired by the poem, All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace. The visuals represent the way living organisms and technology strive to live together in harmony, just as Richard Brautigan states, where they live "together in mutually programming harmony like pure water, touching clear sky." The visual of the vortex with the blooming flowers and deer represent the kind of dynamism of natural living organisms, "where deer stroll peacefully past computers as if they were flowers with spinning blossoms."

This feedback loop of a cybernetic ecology speaks to me with this cyclical nature of the vortex, and the loops of each gif I used, with the flowers endlessly blooming over and over, and the deer restarting their gait. The ability to drag and rearrange these flowers and elements demonstrate the audience's sense of free will and control over what is positioned in the cybernetic garden, but the laptops are not movable due to the nature of technology controlling us now rather than us having control over them.

The draggable tardigrade is another living organism, a microorganism that can be seen only through a microscope, utilizing the way we need technology to uncover an entirely different world. Again, it begs the question, is the web or technology living? The glitchy effect on the flowers add a nice touch, considering they are digital flowers. It goes to show how difficult or unnatural it is to replicate the beauty of nature through an electronic screen.

Images of the brain and neuron speak to what we hope to or "like to think" and imagine for this future, and the connections we make with what is natural life and artificial life, and how it is a complex unknown to think about what it might truly be to live in a cybernetic ecology.
